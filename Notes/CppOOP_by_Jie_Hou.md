Notes taken from the online course [C++ OOP by Jie Hou](https://boolan.com/course/10096)  
  
1. Add header guard in the header file  

2. Let short functions be inline  

3. A class encapsulates data and algorithms  

4. Write a class by thinking its data first and then its algorithms

5. Two types of classes: one has no pointer members and the other has

6. Big Three: copy constructor, assignment operator, destructor

7. Implement the Big Three for classes with pointer members

8. Put const whenever possible

9. Each member function receives *this* pointer as an implicit argument

10. Three fundamental relations between classes: inheritance, composition, and delegation

11. Constructors are called from based to derived clases, while it is reverse for destructor calls

12. Base class must have a virtual destructor

13. A virtual function in a class hierarchy is looked up through the virtual pointer to a virtual table

14. A functor is a function-like class which overloads the operator ()

15. Template specialization is to customize the implementation for some specific types of template parameters
